title: 'QE as a Metric'
---

* [Home](../index.md)

In the last two years we have seen impressive results for reference-free metrics such as COMET-QE [[Rei et al. 2021]](https://aclanthology.org/2021.wmt-1.111/) and OpenKiwi [[Kepler et al, 2019]](https://aclanthology.org/P19-3020/). 

This year the [QE shared task](https://wmt-qe-task.github.io/) will also rely on MQM data and for that reason we encourage participants from the QE shared task to participate in the metrics task simultaneously!

The testsets and analysis performed in this subtask will differ from the ones in the [QE shared task](https://wmt-qe-task.github.io/) but we believe that a well tuned QE system can function as a Metric.

## Subtask Important Dates

The dates for the QE as a metric subtask are exactly the same as the main Metrics task.
